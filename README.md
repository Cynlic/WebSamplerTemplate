# WebSampler Template

## Abstract

The finished project should be a fully functioning, deployed web application with stable access speed and a decent UI. It will allow users to perform sampling of audio files, with specific lowlevel effects, potentially include slicing, convolution, function application. The samples can also be sequenced to an extent. 

## Goals
 - To be determined
 
## Needs 
 - Clojure/ClojureScript
 - WebAudio Api familiarity
 - Cheap server and deployment service, eg Heroku.
 - Scheduled development 
 - Attractive UI for use in portfolios
 - Usability in creative work
   - Audio export?
   - Sequencing?
   - Fast/without audible lag

## Timeline
 - Read the dang book: 
   - Total length is 230 pages minus appendices; each chapter is roughly 30 pages.
   - Reasonable per-week reading: 90-100 pages, give or take depending on subject
   - Week 1: Chapters 1-3
   - Week 2: Chapters 4-7
   - Week 3: Chapters 8&9
 - Trampoline structure over course of weeks 1-3
 - Weeks 4-6: Develop application logic, structure & UI
